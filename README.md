# Bank Repository

You are tasked with creating the infrastructure code for a bank. We will be using private methods and attributes to ensure that the bank data is secure and can not be accessed outside of the bank. 

### To Do's

You will be working in pairs of two

1. Have person A [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) onto their personal account
2. Person A will then [add their partner](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) person B as a collaborator on the repository
3. Next you will implement the necessary code
    * One partner will create a new branch titled `bank-update` and implement the `bank.py` file
    * The other partner will create a new branch titled `user-update` and implement the `user.py` file 
4. Once all the code is implemented person B will submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), which will then be checked by person A and accepted if all code is working

By the end of this project your repository should only have the `main` branch with the `bank.py` and `user.py` files fully implemented and functional.

Please make sure to check your code using the jupyter notebook file!
