# bank-api
Just a bank-api created for the Knowledge House Python course
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to create BankUser classes within Bank classes in order to deposit, withdraw and perform other actions.
# Thought Process
We used this object as a reference for how we should interact with the bank. We decided to split the work between bank.py and user.py so each of us did one of the files.
```
bank_data = {
    "user_name": {
        "password": "users_password",
        "balance": 0.0
    }
}

We decided to make the return values clear and most of the functions will return a string or boolean as a helpful way to show if the functions are performing the expected output.
```
# For users
The code was purposely written with minimal comments, dependencies, etc to ensure that the code is readable and easy to maintain. You can easily import the classes (see test.py)
